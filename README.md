# N322 Final

My n322 final is a CRUD like application that allows a user to signin via email and password and then create and save lists using firestore. Then go inside of a list and add list items. Each user has a collection of lists created in the database.

_Delete button does not work on lists and list items & warning about async persistence_

### Make a simple application using Firebase Authentication.

- You must have a fully styled app that uses authentication.
- You have to have at least two screens
- Make sure you can log in and use the authentication from Firebase
